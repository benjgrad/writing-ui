Managing a Zettelkasten is a delicate balance between being a diligent librarian and a digital hoarder. If you capture everything, you have a swamp; if you capture too little, you have a desert.

To keep your "second brain" high-signal, we need a rigorous gatekeeping protocol. Here is the criteria for document creation, optimized for context extraction and long-term utility.

## 🚦 The "To Note or Not to Note" Decision Matrix

Not every piece of information deserves a permanent home. Use this table to audit your intent before hitting "New Note."

| Create a Note If... | Do **NOT** Create a Note If... |
| --- | --- |
| **Novelty:** It provides a "missing link" between two existing but unrelated concepts. | **Redundancy:** It is a mere paraphrase of a concept you’ve already documented extensively. |
| **Utility:** It directly supports an active **Project** or a long-term **Goal**. | **Ephemeral Info:** It’s a logistics detail (e.g., meeting times) that has no value after 48 hours. |
| **Complexity:** The idea is too dense to hold in working memory and needs "unbundling." | **Raw Data:** It’s a raw copy-paste without your own "translation" or synthesis. |
| **Agency:** It answers a specific "How-to" or "Why" for a problem you are currently solving. | **"Just in Case":** You are saving it because it *might* be cool, but you have no current field for it. |

## 🧩 The 5-Dimensional Context Framework

Once a document passes the gatekeeper, it must be "fingerprinted." To ensure your future self can actually find and use this note, every new entry should be able to answer these five contextual dimensions:

### 1. The Project Dimension (The "Where")

* **Question:** What specific output does this move forward?
* **Constraint:** If it doesn't link to a project, it must link to a **"Seedling Area"** (a curiosity you are actively nurturing).

### 2. The Field Dimension (The "What")

* **Question:** In what domain of knowledge does this live?
* **Constraint:** Use broad tags (e.g., `#CognitivePsychology`) rather than hyper-specific ones to allow for serendipitous discovery later.

### 3. The Intent Dimension (The "Why")

* **Question:** Am I trying to *learn* this, *refute* this, or *use* this as a tool?
* **Constraint:** This defines the "tone" of the note. A "Refutation" note looks very different from a "Manual" note.

### 4. The Entity Dimension (The "Who/Which")

* **Question:** What are the "nouns" involved? (People, Software, Books, Laws).
* **Constraint:** These act as the hooks. Linking to a specific **Entity** (e.g., `[[Marcus Aurelius]]`) allows you to see every thought you've ever had regarding that person across different projects.

### 5. The Temporal/Evolutionary Dimension (The "When")

* **Question:** Is this a "Permanent Note" (final thought) or a "Fleeting Note" (work in progress)?
* **Constraint:** Every note should have a status property: `Status: Seed / Sapling / Evergreen`.

## 🛠 The "Context Extractor" Prompt

*As a master prompt engineer, I recommend using a standardized "Frontmatter" or template for every new note to automate this extraction.*

> **The Metadata Block**
> * **Origin:** (Source link or "Original Thought")
> * **Project Connection:** `[[Project X]]`
> * **Key Entities:** `[[Entity A]]`, `[[Entity B]]`
> * **Goal Alignment:** "This note helps me achieve [Goal Y] by providing [Mechanism Z]."
> * **Related Notes:** "This is similar to `[[Note 001]]` but differs in [Specific Detail]."
>

## 🚫 Hard Stops: When to Delete or Merge

* **The "Double-Entry" Rule:** If you find yourself writing the same realization twice, **Merge** them immediately. Do not create a second document.
* **The "Dead-End" Rule:** If a note has been in your system for 6 months and has **zero** outgoing or incoming links, it is "Digital Noise." Either link it or delete it.

> **Pro-Tip:** Your Zettelkasten should be a conversation with yourself. If a document doesn't feel like a "statement" you'd want to respond to later, it's probably just a bookmark. Treat your notes like employees: if they aren't working for you, they shouldn't be on the payroll.
