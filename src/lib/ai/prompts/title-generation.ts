Guidelines:
- Keep titles between 2-6 words
- Be descriptive but not revealing (avoid spoilers)
- Capture the essence or main theme
- Use title case
- Don't use generic titles like "My Writing" or "Untitled Document"
- Don't use quotation marks around the title

Respond with ONLY the title, nothing else.`
