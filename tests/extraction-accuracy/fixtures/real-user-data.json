      "title": "Platform Enhancement Word Cloud Strategy",
      "content": "So right now Im thinking about how to improve the platform and theres a bunch of ways. First of all, i think the goals arent sufficient for giving full picture of what people are trying to work on (and therefore what they would be interested in an atomic note of). It feels as if there should be a word cloud that is initially formed of all the person's interests by starting to ask them about all of the things they're interested in. Maybe we can populate/update the word cloud using their notes, by counting instances and references to people, places, projects, things... obviously we can't count all the words... or maybe we can?\n\nOnce we have the word cloud, we can prompt the user to understand what their relationship is. Maybe we can connect this to some goals, or if the user doesnt have goals set pertaining to this topic, we can prompt them to set them.\n\nHeres the issue Im trying to solve: in out current system of note extraction, I dont know if we would extract a note when i share a recipe for new orleans style pork and beans. On the one hand, this is not relating to any of my goals -- living for a love ethic, building my glutes and getting a new job. This doesnt capture what it actually means to me though. I like cooking and want to be able to capture and organize these recipes. Andrew shared this recipe with me, so its significant in that way. And finally, Danielle used to work at a new Orleans style restaurant, and might enjoy this at some point. \n\nMaybe if i capture this word cloud i can capture the things in the users life that really matter to them--not just their productive goals.\nMaybe the issue is Im trying to capture everything. i want to know everything about every aspect of a person's life, and thats a really difficult, maybe impossible task. How can I organize recipes in the same place as their career aspirstions and relationship memories, and self-reflections? \nThe tension comes from trying to capture everything.\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe the difficulty is just visualizing all this information. To present a robot with 50 goals and tasks and ask it to classify data doesnt seem unreasonable. YOU'RE being unreasonable! Jokes aside, the issue could be in presenting this information back to the user. It doesnt promote growth or action of any kind.\n\nAnywho, im just chilling at Danielle's this morning while she sleeps. I tried a bidet and i updated my linked ",

Let me test the backspace. It now allows backspace past two words, which is wrong. Also, as the user types, if the words are disappearing in the previous row, the words from the curent row float to the previous row, which is bad. I want each word to remain on the row in which it is written as it disappears. \nWell at least the cursor is gone now. \nThe text size still seems smaller, and I don't know if the words are going to float up into the previous line as they disappear, but as I type it doesn't seem like they will. Now, there's still the scroll issues. I can't see the top nav in the editor, I can't see the prompt without scrolling down, there's two scrollbars, which is bad UX and I think it's just a bug. whenever I start typing, it doesn't focus the are in which I'm typing.Okay now the prompt doesn't disappear when I scroll up, We also don't center the current typed line when we start typing.

I can just find job postings and start sending those out. Instead, for some reason I'm thinking of the next several steps. When the recruiter reviews my application, I should have my professional website up-to-date with my latest work experience of course.

      "content": "Right now, I feel like I'm just trying to get through the day. I want to find motivation to change my career, but doing so involves a huge effort. I want to be able to build the skills of time management, discipline, and clarity of thought. To me, I think stress management is the greatest lever to moving all of the things that I want to change. By focusing on my stress, I can build neuroplasticity, allowing me to think about the direction of my life and actualize it using the default mode network and the executive control network. Similarly, I need to be able to switch between global and local thinking patterns, which can only happen when my stress is under control. \n\nWhen the stress is most manageable my body demands a lot more movement. I have been running and stretching and it has felt great. For the first time in a few weeks, my hips and back aren't sore at all, which I didn't even realize was such a blessing.\n\nI don't think my body is very good at managing stress, but I think it's good at identifying stress. I've found some meditation breathing techniques seem to closely emulate hyperventilation. It seems my body instinctively knows in times of great anxiety that a clarity of mind can be acheived by trying to overload the body with oxygen. Breathing seems to be a very effective way of regulating my stress. This is a good response, but doesn't really prevent stress. \n\nSomething else I've learned about is the concept of stress innoculation. By introducing stress to my daily life in a controlled way, like with a plank, cold plunges, etc. I can fortify my ability to overcome adversity. This also becomes something I can consciously draw on to give myself pep talks whenever I need it. Aparrently David Goggins calls it his mental cookie jar -- when he needs it, he takes the memory of the things he's accomplished to nourish him mentally.\n",

      "content": "This morning I am taking my time, and loving myself. As I continue to learn about love, and how to love, I choose to focus first on self-love, as is foretold by our lord and saviour, bell hooks. Okay, so I know that part of love is understanding, and another is respect, and maybe responsibility/accountability... Comittment! I guess I do need to work on comitting to myself, but I don't know if that's the whole story. Certainly I need to work on being responsible to myself. I keep making choices that aren't in my self-interest. I should tell Danielle this. I think this is what I want her to know-- I care about her so deeply but I don't yet love her, because I can't love her yet. I'm still learning how to love. I'm still learning how to love myself, because I am not being responsible for myself yet. This can be my honesty and communication. I also want to revisit what bell hooks mentions about honesty, because there's definitely some valueable information there. \n\nI think another thing I can do to be responsible for myself is tracking all of the things I need to do for myself (like booking doctors' appointments, and paying bills) and then following up on them. This is something that I do struggle with, and I want to improve in my life. \n\nI do have to be a little bit careful though. I don't want to disqualify how I feel or my experience because I am not worthy of it yet. When I say that I can't love until I learn how to love myself, I feel thatthere are still things that I currently do that show myslef love. I do reflect often, and work to better understand myself. I respect my own experience. I work to be responsible for myself. Not always, but I do. I don't want this kind of self-love to be the self love that I always show myself, nor do I want it to reflect the kind of love I show others. I smoked cigarettes for years, and drank heavily. The kind of self-love I show does come with compassionate self-understanding. I don't draw the line in the sand and say that I am not worthy of love, or joy or comfort. I want to extend this to others, but at the same time, I wonder if I would want to show the ones around me a different kind of love while they were experiencing addiction, or struggling with their ADHD, or career. Maybe I am being responsible for myself. Maybe it's just a balancing act? I don't really know. ",

      "content": "I'm making progress on this journaling interface powered by AI, but I'm still not sure what it is. The typing interface itself is really nice. There's lots of room for improvement, but that's okay. It doesn't need to be perfect. Instead, I'm focusing more on the AI side of things. I want to continue providing more and better context to the AI. I'm doing this by starting an AI-driven coaching interface. The chat interface works pretty well. It can take notes, help set milestones, refine motivations, etc. I'm not exactly sure if this is what we need from a behavioural psychology perspective, but that's okay... I'll continue to refine it later. In the meantime, I want to continue working on solidifying how I'm going to leverage the goals. I know the most obvious way is to add it as context to the prompt generation for user writing prompts. Other than that, I do want a user's journal entries to contribute towards their milestone and goal tracking. I also want to use the zettelkasten-style notes to inform strategies in our coaching chats. I think what I'm hoping for, generally, is the ability to build a comprehensive profile of the user that I can show back to the user. I also want to use this user profile for creating custom insights, actions, strategies, and more. Maybe I could publish a customized MCP that other agents could consume. I would want information on the values the user holds, the people that the user is close to, the fields of interest the user has, so AI could read articles, emails, etc. and provide specific suggestions, digests and notifications. Maybe even suggest scheduling changes. \n\nAll of these things are part of my Executive Control Network, which is something I'm learning about because of my interest in developing neuroplasicity. I want to be able to smothly transition between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Executive Control Network (ECN). For me this allows more fluid explorations of subjects. This involves practicing noticing and asking without judgement. Relaxing, opening my gaze and posture and asking the questions \"What system is this a part of?\", \"What else does this affect\",\"What assumptions am I making\" and \"What is this really about?\". This means no lists, no solutions, and no judgement. Ironically, as I build this stream-of-conciousness journalling app, I am working almost exclusively in my ECN. This is why it's so important for me to practice these things.\nThe transition between DMN and ECN requires metacognition. I should practice it by firmly acknowledging when I switch modalities of thought. Only then can I swich to ECN. I practice this by defining one clear objective. All thinking and ideation should be limited to bullet points. Finally, I should end the practice by switching back.",

      "content": "I am now continuing to work on the writing ui and I'm testing out the text fading behaviour and general editing experience. The words rise to the line above to fade which is wrong. The line wraps sometimes in the middle of a word, which also is wrong. As a word is on a line that's not disappearing, bu the text from the previous line disappears, the words from the line that's not disappearing will shift onto the line that's disappearing. Instead, I want the words to remain on the line that they're currently part of, and the words to shift so the line text-align remains centered. I the user is still typing as the words from that line are disappearing however, all new user inputs should appear on the next line -- as if there is a line break. The words can also be erased without limitation--I only want the user to be able terase the last two words.If they try to backspace any further than that it should have no effect. Finally, the current line should always be vertically centered when the user starts typing. All transitions and animations should be smooth. Now we're testing again. I can still erase more than two words. Words remain on their current line as they disappear, but the words don't wrap to the next line until after the word currently being typed disappears. The word doesnt go to the next line until the user continues typing for a few words. Also sometimes the line doesn't remain centered. I want the words to recenter in the disappearing line SLOWLY. Okay so are we still fading the letters incorrectly? I want to know if the words wrap immediatelyor not.It's Its still not exactly right, but it seems the backspace limitation is not working though. Also the fading is slow, but the letters shif upwards as they fade fairly abruptly.\nAre the words fading out correctly?\nI don't know if the words are currentlyappearingif the words fade and recenter or anything\n\nOkay lets keep trying to see if the words disappear more smoothly.

I never know what's going to happen, and that's both humbling and exciting. Sometimes just practicing with my typing in a UX testing capacity has been helpful. It lets me get my thoughts out in a very organic way. I don't really know what to say. The shifting of letters to the left as I type is still fairly jumpy, and fading of letters isn't nice either -- the new words aren't being added to a new line, instead the words that are dissapearing are being moved to a new(previous) line before they are faded out. Additionally, the user's newest text is not remaining vertically aligned. I guess none of this matters right now.
